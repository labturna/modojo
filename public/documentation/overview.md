# Overview

**Motoko** is a modern, general-purpose programming language you can use specifically to author ICP canister smart contracts. Although aimed primarily at ICP canister development, its design is general enough to support future compilation to other targets.

Motoko is designed to be approachable for programmers who have some basic familiarity with object-oriented and/or functional programming idioms in either JavaScript, or another modern programming language, such as Rust, Swift, TypeScript, C#, or Java.

## Motoko provides:

- A high-level language for programming applications to run on ICP.
- A simple design that uses familiar syntax that is easy for programmers to learn.
- An actor-based programming model optimized for efficient message handling.
- An interpreter and compiler that you can use to test and compile the WebAssembly code for autonomous applications.
